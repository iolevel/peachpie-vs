# PeachPie extension for Visual Studio

This extension adds support for PHP projects running compiled on .NET/.NET Core using [PeachPie compiler](https://www.peachpie.io). It is compatible with VS2017+ and is designed to simplify working with PeachPie compiler in the Visual Studio IDE.

## What this allows you to do
PeachPie compiles PHP to .NET/.NET Core and replaces its runtime with the modern, secure and performant dotnet environment. As a result, you can use this extension to treat PHP projects as if they were written in .NET and interoperate seamlessly with your applications written, for example, in C#:
* __Manage dependencies__: distribute your PHP app as a project reference, which you can specify within your other projects
* __Interoperate between PHP and .NET__: seamlessly connect PHP and .NET code within a single solution
* __Sourceless distribution__: distribute compiled PHP applications without their source code
* __Diagnostics__: debug PHP code with .NET's precision
* __Performance profiling__: take advantage of running PHP compiled to .NET with Visual Studio's powerful performance profiling tools

>Note: this extension is designed for PHP projects running on .NET via PeachPie compiler.
