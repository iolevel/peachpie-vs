        <h2>Getting Started</h2>
        <p>You've just created a basic ASP.NET Core application which in addition serves compiled PHP scripts.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>
            The solution consists of two separate projects:
            <ul>
                <li><b>$safeprojectname$</b>; is the PHP project. Its PHP script files (*.php) get compiled and served by the web server.</li>
                <li><b>$safeprojectname$.Server</b>; implements the default Web Server. It is a startup project which handles web requests and serves the compiled PHP scripts, static files, Razor views and other ASP.NET Core end-points.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>PHP Source Files</h3>
        <p>
            PHP source files are placed within the <span>$safeprojectname$</span> project. Upon building the project, the compiler parses the files, provides additional diagnostics, and outputs a single binary .dll file.
        </p>

        <h3>Content Files</h3>
        <p>
            Unlike in regular PHP application, compile and content files are treated separately here. Content files are not compiled and they will only be served by the web server as a static file.
        </p>
        <p>
            Place your content files (images and stylesheets, and other non-compile items) into the <code>/wwwroot/</code> folder within the <span>$safeprojectname$.Server</span> project.
        </p>
